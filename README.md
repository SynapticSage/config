# config

This repo houses my major config files, so I can keep work on them synced across the different machines I develop code/ideas.

## Table of contents

| file | program | purpose |
|------|---------|-------------|
| .vimrc | neovim | where I do most of my code development |
| .tmux.conf | tmux | organized panes of tasks, including development |
| .spacemacs | space-emacs | where I organize my ideas (org-mode, which vim does not do well) |

## What's not here
...but still important across machines
